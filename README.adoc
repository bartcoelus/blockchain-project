This project implements decentralized home battery management through the proposed standards https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1056[ERC-1056] and https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/780[ERC-780]. Currently only identity creation and home battery production and commissioning are provided.
The project consists of a server, which exposes a REST API for smart contract interaction, and a client which consumes said REST API. We implement the project in this manner to eliminate the need for Ethereum wallets or Ethereum-enabled browsers. However, do not confuse this for a centralized application: identities and home batteries are still connected to separate wallets, although these are funded by a central wallet whenever a transaction needs to take place.

## Prerequisites

- *Node.js* this project has been tested with version 12.x of Node.js

## Setup

To set up the application, we need to set up both the server and the client.

### Server

To set up the server, we first need to deploy the smart contracts via Truffle. Navigate to the `/server` directory from the root of this repository in a terminal of your choice and execute the following commands:

....
npm install
npx truffle develop
....

These commands open the Truffle console and fire up Ganache. To deploy the smart contracts from the Truffle console, execute:

....
truffle migrate
....

Keep Truffle open and in a new terminal window, start the REST API from the `/server` directory through the following command:

....
node index.js
....

The server will now be running at http://localhost:3000. Be sure to keep this terminal window open as well, or the server shuts down.

### Client

After setting up the server, navigate to the `/client` directory from this repository's root and execute the following commands to run the client:

....
npm install
npx webpack-dev-server
....

The Webpack bundle analyzer will show the size of the client-side web application in your browser and you will find its URI in the terminal output. Navigate to it in a web browser to interact with the application.
